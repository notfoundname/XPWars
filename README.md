You are currently viewing XPWars 2.x branch. It is far from being done.

## What does this addon do?
It replaces default currency system. I mean, when you pick up a bronze or anything else, it will add levels to your XP bar.
<br />It also does some other things like buyable kits, game inventories ect.
