You are currently viewing XPWars 2.x branch.

## What does this addon do?
It replaces default currency system. I mean, when you pick up a bronze or anything else, it will add levels to your XP bar. Some servers had that system since 2015 and I kinda like it.
<br>It also adds some other things like buyable kits, game inventories, better sidebar, more special items.

## Requirements
- Paper â‰¥ 1.9.4 (1.8.8 may work but is not recommended)
- ScreamingBedwars latest 0.2.x release
- PlaceholderAPI (optional)
